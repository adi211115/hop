# Discripition
A port of autojump: the directory navigator, more info [here](https://github.com/wting/autojump), in rust.

# Installation
Actually it's a work in progress. But you can always try installing it manually by cloning the repo and put the appropirate files where they belong! Of course that does mean that you know that you are doing, cheers!
